    "description": "I moved my masturbatory practice fully online around 1997/1998, before that it had been restricted to found, stolen and inherited printed matter. My online transfer was systematic, not being as centralized as pornography is today it required trawling through hundreds of websites to find the perfect match to my particular mood and taste that day. Most of my sexual preferences were cemented in those early days, each pornographic trip refining my taste slightly. But more importantly I developed a pornographic way of seeing, now I see everything pornographically, I cant help myself, although I don’t think its just me. I like to see a lot of variations of one thing, I need to go through a couple of thousand of anything before I understand it. Or its like instead of an idea being about one image, like the Vietnam war being that girl running naked away from a napalmed village, it’s a ton of images which sum everything up. If there arnt at least a million variations of something it probably isn’t worth it."
